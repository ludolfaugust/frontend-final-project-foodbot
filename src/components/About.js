            Hi, I´m foodBot! I will make the best of your Ingredients. Just pick
            what you got and let me think about it...To give you a wide variety
            of different Recipes I won´t insist on all the spices. If you don´t
            have all the spices that should be added to the recipe you can find
            an alternative yourself. I trust in your creativity. I will serve
            you with great ideas and the main ingredients needed, you can
            finalize the recipe with your own brainwork. Low carb doesn’t have
            to mean eating carnivore. We offer plenty of vegetarian choices,
            enjoyed by dedicated low-carb vegetarians and meat eaters alike. If
            you choose a so-called lacto-ovo vegetarian way of eating, low carb
            will provide all the nutrients you need. Lacto-ovo means avoiding
            meat, poultry, and fish, while also eating vegetables, nuts, eggs,
            and dairy.
            <br /> <br />
            <h2>What vegetables are preferred ?</h2>
            <br /> <br />A rule of thumb is to avoid those that grow underground
            — and eat what grows above. Picking what’s in season is often the
            best option for many reasons. It’s easier to find organically and
            locally grown produce and they’re often more affordable.
            <br /> <br />
            <h2>Vegetarian meals</h2>
            <br /> <br />
            Use your imagination and creativity when putting together a
            vegetarian low-carb meal. Whatever you decide to make, you can
            always add a bit of fat to your plant-based dish by slicing up some
            fresh avocado or topping it with a smooth dollop of mayo.
            <br /> <br />
            Experiment with different textures and seasonings to create your own
            favorite recipes.
